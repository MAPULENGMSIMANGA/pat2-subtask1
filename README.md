Brief overview
Morse code is a method of telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals), or sometimes referred to as "dits" and "dahs."
•	Representation: Each letter of the alphabet, numeral, and some punctuation marks are represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes.
•	Transmission: These codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varying lengths (originally through telegraph wires), or via other mediums like radio waves, sound, or light (e.g., flashing lights). A dot is a short tone or flash, and a dash is a longer one (typically three times the length of a dot).
•	Timing: The precise timing of the dots, dashes, and the spaces between them is crucial for accurate interpretation. There are short spaces between the elements within a character, slightly longer spaces between letters, and even longer spaces between words.
•	History: It was developed in the 1830s by Samuel F.B. Morse, an American artist and inventor, for use with his electric telegraph system. Over time, it was refined, leading to the International Morse Code, which is the most widely used version today.
•	Purpose: Initially revolutionary for long-distance communication via telegraph, Morse code has seen various applications over the years, including maritime communication (like the SOS distress signal: ⋅⋅⋅−−−⋅⋅⋅), aviation, amateur radio, and as an assistive technology.
While less common in everyday communication now due to newer technologies, Morse code still holds significance in specific fields and for enthusiasts.
